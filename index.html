                    A function is a program designed to perform a particular task within our code that we can declare for later use.  There are several ways to write functions in Js including fat arrow functions which were introduced in es6.

        <section id="Objects">

            <img src="./projphotos/object-scrn.jpg">
            <p>
                In JavaScript, almost everything is an object. An object is a datatype that consists of key / value pairs. Objects can contain many values and are used in just about every chunk of code we write.

        <section id="Arrays">
            <h1 class="animated bounceInDown
         delay-3s">Arrays</h1>
         <img src="./projphotos/array-scrn.jpg">
            <p>
                An Array is an object in JavaScript which stores multiple different values in a single variable. Arrays are a great solution to storing large amounts of information since we are able to loop through them and pull the information we have stored later on.
